## Overview

Installs CIC, Interaction Firmware and Media Server silently.
Also contains functionality to create ICSurvey files to run the Setup Assistant manually.

## Module Description

Uses ruby to create an xml file with the options pre-populated from a template (.erb) file. Allows quick unattended configuration of CIC.

## Setup

### What install affects

* Installs CIC, Interaction Firmware and Media Server.
* Warning: not recommended for production environments.

### What icsurvey affects

* Creates an .icsurvey file.
* Warning: not recommended for production environments.

### Setup Requirements **OPTIONAL**

If your module requires anything extra before setting up (pluginsync enabled,
etc.), mention it here.

### Beginning with install

The very basic steps needed for a user to get the module up and running.

If your most recent release breaks compatibility or requires particular steps
for upgrading, you may wish to include an additional section here: Upgrading
(For an example, see http://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/firewall).
